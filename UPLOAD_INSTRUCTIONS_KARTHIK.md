git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Feature-aware adversarial attacks for MANET IDS

Novel Contributions:
- Domain-constrained adversarial attack methodology
- Manifold-based realism evaluation (KD-tree)
- Comprehensive epsilon sweep analysis (8 values)
- On-manifold adversarial examples (0.99x distance ratio)

Complete package includes:

## 💬 ANNOUNCEMENT TEMPLATES

### For LinkedIn

```
Excited to share my latest research project! 🎓

I've just open-sourced my work on "Feature-Aware Adversarial Attacks for MANET Intrusion Detection Systems" - a novel approach to realistic adversarial evaluation using domain constraints.

🔬 Key Innovation: Unlike standard attacks that create physically impossible network traffic, our feature-aware methodology respects MANET network physics while maintaining attack effectiveness.

📊 Key Results:
• Standard attacks: 99.9% success but 5.7× off-manifold (unrealistic)
• Feature-aware attacks: 1.9% success but 0.99× on-manifold (realistic!)

🔗 Full implementation, datasets, and publication-quality results available on GitHub:
https://github.com/vssk18/manet-adversarial-ids

Special thanks to my advisor Dr. Arshad Ahmad Khan Mohammad at GITAM University for guidance on this project.
